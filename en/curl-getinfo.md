The PHP function `curl_getinfo()` provides detailed information about the executed cURL request. This article explains the meaning of each field.

Example usage
---------------

Call the function over the result of the context from `curl_init()`:

```php
$ch = curl_init();
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, 'https://baraja.cz');
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, 0);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 0);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_NOBODY, 1);
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, 0);
curl_exec($ch);
$info = curl_getinfo($ch);
curl_close($ch);

dump($info);
```

Table of values
--------------

The `curl_getinfo()` function returns an associative array from which individual keys and values can be retrieved.
