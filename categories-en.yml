	description: '''
		Algorithms are instructions for solving specific problems. At a basic level, we can think of an algorithm as a cookbook, because it describes the steps of how to produce a finished dish from the input ingredients quite precisely.

		In programming, there are whole families of algorithms that are useful for solving different types of problems. However, if you're looking for tutorials on how to tackle app design as a whole, you'll need to reach for more powerful tools such as <a href="/category-design-patterns">design patterns</a>.

	name: Design patterns
	description: '''
		If you've been programming for a long time, you've also noticed that much of the code and development principles are repeated over and over again.

		When it comes to closed logic problems, solving these parts of the application can be referred to as <a href="/algorithms">algorithms</a>. But how do you address the application design as a whole in a much more general way and not just focus on specific parts? That's what **design patterns** are for, which describe architectural ideas and best-practices in software design.

		The purpose of design patterns is to formalize large chunks of the application and set some boundaries that will allow you to complete even complicated applications and delegate work to many team members.

	name: Object-oriented programming in PHP
	description: '''
		Object Oriented Programming (OOP for short) is a programming paradigm that brings significant simplification of development work.

		The main advantages of OOP are the division of code into individual parts (objects and methods) that can be easily transferred between projects (abstraction and encapsulation) to build reusable applications. OOP also introduces new techniques such as inheritance and polymorphism for the first time.

		This entire section of the site describes the benefits of OOP development in an extensive way. You will soon discover that although OOP has its problems too, it is actually the best methodology to build something if you care about code reusability and long-term support for applications you have already written.
